=======================

I was looking for a nice template in beamer,
simple, and with a modern font...I didn't find one.

So, I took a simple theme, and I start to modify
some colors and fonts.

BE AWARE
--------

* This is not a well-structured beamer theme,
  it is just a *sty* file with some custom configuration.
* I have the font called *Eurostile*, so you can change it
  inside the *sty* file.
* The colors are also defined there.
* Your logo must be called *logo* and must be inside in the
  *img* directory.
